dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm

MY UPDATES!

-added layout scroll using MOD+Shift+H/L
-replaced old setlayout keybind MOD+Space with focusmaster
-fakefullscreen installed
-new keybind MOD+Shift+Space to keep window on top
-grid layout added
-Added alpha patch
-Increased fontsize of bar && used new font..
-ADDED NEW SCREENSHOT BINDS (scrot required) 
	- MODKEY + Print = Fullscreen-shot
	- Print = Selective screenshot (-s flag) 
-Added mouse warping on focus stack + monitor switching
-Added new layout! Bottom stack. This gave me some errors so I
referenced similar functions and formatted them similarly
e.g. changing the static void -> void at the top of the function and
creating a new line for the opening curly bracket instead of 
seating it on the end of 'bstack(Monitor *m)'. You can check the diff
file and split it with the actual file to see what was changed and 
why it works...
-Added named scratchpads patch
